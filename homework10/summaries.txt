Command
The Command design pattern turns a request into a single object that contains the information about that request, but now allows you to pass requests as method 
arguments. The command is to protect harry potter in the program but there are multiple options of doing so and the same command is carried out three different ways.

Interpreter
The Interpreter design pattern defines the grammar of a particular language in a way which can be evaluated by the interpreter itself. 
This is shown by the program interpreting the phrases in the magic phrases text file and printing a tree of speech labels (Verb, noun, pronoun, etc.) 
corresponding to the individual words in the phrase.

Memento
The Memento design pattern lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing its implementation details. 
In the program storylines are saved to the memento and can be restored for later use. 
The memento pattern is shown when the latest storyline is printed from the saved states for storylines 1 and 4.

State
The State design pattern lets an object change its behavior when its state changes. 
This is shown in the program by when creating a state for DADA Year 2 and changing its state to DADA Year 3 and subsequently its behaviors to that of DADA Year 3, 
teacher to Remus Lupin and background to null.
