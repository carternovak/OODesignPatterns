Originally the solution code provided by the book was incorrect and the assertion throws error when executing the code. <p>
The code was changed to adding count before the elements.length == count condition in the add function, because the count was inaccurate. <p>
Adding before and after variables made it easier to track if the assertion was performing correctly. <p>
"(tail - head - count) % elements.length == 0" is an invariant because count gets incremented one and so does tail, 
cancelling out the additions and creating the same result: "(tail - head - count) % elements.length == 0" <p>
