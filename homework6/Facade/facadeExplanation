My interpretation of the code provided for the Facade Design pattern is that these paths created for the Built-In Floo Network act as facades 
to the more in detail and complicated specific locations. The path contains neighborhoods that group certain locations together. 
Instead of traveling to the location you can travel along the path created that has neighborhoods of which may contain the location.
