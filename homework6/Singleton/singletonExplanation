After running the Singleton application, it is apparent that even though two separate instances of MinisterForMagic's are made with different information. 
Since the first minister created was Cornelius Fudge, attempting to draw information on any other minister will return Cornelius. 
When retiring instances of MinisterForMagic's and reinstantiated minister 2 "Pius Thicknesse" you are now able to access the information of that object. 
And to test this I attempted to reinitialize minister 1 as Cornelius Fudge and print out both ministers but only Pius Thicknesse shows.

The Singleton Design Pattern highlights only allowing one object to be created but also shared amongst the application. 
More objects created after the first object will share the information of the first object.
